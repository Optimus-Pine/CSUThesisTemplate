User Instructions

Download the files under the "Contents" section above. Write your main document in the .tex file, and edit the \bibliography line to reference your own .bib file. Remember to build BibTeX > LaTeX > LaTex in order to view your document with citations. Troubleshoot errors, recompile, rinse and repeat. Fight the urge to give up, because you can do this. So say we all.
