% Sample dissertation template - Colorado State University PhD 

% This template is meant as a starting point for formatting a PhD 
% thesis to meet the requirements of the graduate school at
% Colorado State University.

%%% 		Dependencies %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The nosmallcaps command gets rid of the smallcaps font in the titles, which looks nice but is non-standard according to Grad School.
% NOTE - SP We may want to remove this option and just include it in the new class file 
\documentclass[nosmallcaps]{csuthesis} 

\usepackage{amsfonts, amsmath, amssymb, amsthm} % Standard AMS Libs
\usepackage{float} 	% Allows overriding of float placement by
					% using the placement specifier H
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{placeins} 	% So we can use \FloatBarrier command 
						% Important to keep figures from migrating 						% into chapters where they don't belong!
\usepackage[all]{nowidow} 	% This helps prevent widow lines, 	
							% which the Grad School doesn't like!
\usepackage{lipsum}	% Allows us to fill in nonsense text
					% Remove this from your document

% NOTE - SP We may be able to move these to the class file
% These commands help prevent orphan and widow lines by setting their penalties to "infinite badness." The Grad School forbids orphan and widow lines!!
\widowpenalty10000
\clubpenalty10000

% These two commands are needed to prevent large, awkward white spaces between sections and around equations, 
% which the Grad School apparently hates with the passion of a thousand fiery suns. 
% So you'll get gaps at the bottom of the page instead. As long as these aren't too big, it is okay.
% If you get very large white space at the bottoms of pages, they may complain about that, and then
% you may be stuck rewording your paragraphs. 
\raggedbottom % Tells LaTex it's okay to not fill text all the way to the bottom of the page.
\allowdisplaybreaks % Allows large blocks of equations to be split up across pages.


% NOTE - SP This might also be able to move to class file
% This makes the bibliography left-aligned, as per Graduate School requirements. LaTex default will get rejected!!!
\makeatletter
\renewcommand{\@biblabel}[1]{[#1]\hfill}
\makeatother

% NOTE - SP Move to class file?
% This is a modification of the commands to make chapter headings from Leif's template.
% Leif's template makes the font size larger and in small caps for chapter headings. Grad School DID NOT approve!!
% This code block overrides the chapter heading definitions in the .cls file.
